# Text based game
This game is an adventure game in which you have to escape the desert

# Features
You have to play the game to get a good grasp of all of the features but here are some of them.
* Delay between sentences to make it easier to read
* Ability to save score at the end of the game
* You can forage or use an item whenever you want
* The player has three attributes: health, hunger, and water
* Most things in this game are randomized so you shoulddn't have the same game twice.
* Also it has a lot of content. It took a long time to write.
* Those are all the good features. You can find some more as you go along

# Packages
You need to have pyfiglet installed for this to work. But if you run it in repl.it it should work.

Also if you are reading this on github, run the main.py file and in your terminal or command prompt type
pip install pyfiglet
